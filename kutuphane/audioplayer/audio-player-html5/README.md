HTML5 WP Audio Player
----

This project is a version of the awesome [WordPress Audio Player](http://wpaudioplayer.com/standalone/) by [Martin Laine](http://www.1pixelout.net/) for browsers that support HTML5's `<audio>` tag, with fallback to the original WP Audio Player for browsers that don't.

[Check out the demo!](http://jedfoster.github.com/html5-WP-audio-player/)

Originally, this was going to be a skin on top of [AudioJS](https://github.com/jedfoster/AudioJS), but I ended up gutting that project's default CSS to such an extent that I decided to start from scratch for this project. The result is a lean, mean stylesheet with loads of customization potential.

The `speaker`, `play`, and `pause` icons are from [Tipogram](http://tipogram.com), by [Tom Creighton](http://twitter.com/tomcreighton) who graciously granted permission for me to include them in this project.

The loading `spinner` icons are from [Web Symbols](http://www.justbenicestudio.com/studio/websymbols/)
